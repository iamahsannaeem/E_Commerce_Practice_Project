   - A hover effect on product images enhances interactivity, providing a sleek and modern browsing experience.
   - The navigation bar at the top includes links to categories like Men, Women, Kids, Home & Living, Beauty, and Studio, alongside icons for search, user account, wishlist, and cart, ensuring easy navigation.

2. **Shopping Cart Page:**
   - The cart page displays a list of products that the user has added to their cart. Each item includes a thumbnail, name, brand, pricing details, discount, return policy, and expected delivery date.
   - Users can remove items from the cart with a single click, and the cart dynamically updates the total amount.
   - A detailed summary of the order is provided, including total MRP, discount applied, convenience fee, and the final payable amount. The "Place Order" button facilitates the checkout process.
